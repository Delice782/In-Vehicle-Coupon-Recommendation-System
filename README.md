A machine learning project that predicts whether a user will accept a coupon based on contextual and behavioral data in an in-vehicle environment.

# Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict coupon acceptance in an in-vehicle recommendation system. Using features such as weather conditions, passenger information, time of day, and user preferences, the model helps businesses optimize their coupon targeting strategies.

# Dataset
The dataset contains 12,684 instances of coupon offerings with various features:

 - User destination and travel companions
 - Environmental conditions (weather, temperature)
 - Timing information
 - User preferences and habits
 - Coupon characteristics
 - Demographic information

### Data source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (CC BY 4.0)
